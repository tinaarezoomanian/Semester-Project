## üå§Ô∏è Day/Night Modes

- The scene switches between day and night by toggling a boolean flag (isDay), which changes the skybox textures and lighting to simulate time of day. 
- Users can control this by pressing the N key for night and M key for day.

## ‚≠ï Hell Mode

- Hell mode transforms the environment into a darker, more intense version by changing terrain textures to lava and altering the skybox. 
- It can be toggled using the H key and plays a distinct sound effect when activated.

## üêî Chickens with Audio

- Chickens spawn randomly on top of the terrain. They like to randomly walk across terrain but never fall off the edge.
- Audio is used to enhance immersion with ambient chicken clucks and a sound cue for entering hell mode. Chickens randomly emit sounds from their 3D positions.

## üõ† How to Run

1. Make sure you have **JDK 17+** and **LWJGL 2.9.2**
2. Place all required `.png` textures in the `textures/` folder
3. Compile and run `Basic.java`
4. Ensure working directory is set to project root
